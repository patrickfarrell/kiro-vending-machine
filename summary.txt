I built a fully functional vending machine using TDD with the Red-Green-Refactor approach. All 8 features have been implemented:

Accept Coins - Identifies coins by weight/diameter, accepts valid coins (nickels, dimes, quarters), rejects pennies
Select Product - Three products (Cola $1.00, Chips $0.50, Candy $0.65) with proper display messages
Make Change - Returns correct change using available coins
Return Coins - Allows customers to get their money back
Sold Out - Tracks inventory and displays when products are unavailable
Exact Change Only - Displays when machine cannot make change
Empty Coin Return - Customers can take their change
User Interface - Web-based UI with vending machine appearance, auto-reset after 5 seconds
Technical Highlights
21 unit tests covering all business logic
Business logic completely independent of Spring (easily testable)
Clean architecture with separation of concerns
13 git commits following TDD workflow (Red → Green → Refactor)
Runs locally with ./gradlew clean build bootRun
No databases or external dependencies
The application is ready to run at http://localhost:8080 after executing ./gradlew bootRun.
